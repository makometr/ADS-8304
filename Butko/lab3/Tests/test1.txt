Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus

Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares

Your own personal Jesus

Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there 
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
