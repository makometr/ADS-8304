<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span>Shannon-Fano coding algorithm</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><span> The input comes in order of non-increasing frequency data. </span></li>
<li><span>There is a middle that divides the alphabet into approximately two parts. These parts (sums of alphabet frequencies) are approximately equal.</span></li>
<li><span> For the left side, &ldquo;0&rdquo; is assigned, for the right side &ldquo;1&rdquo;, so we get the leaves of the tree. </span></li>
<li><span>Step 2 is repeated until we get a single element of the sequence, i.e. sheet</span></li>
